**Title:** We built Stripe for AI agents – pay-per-call APIs with stablecoins

**Body:**

Hey HN! Solo builder here.

I've been watching the AI agent space explode, but noticed a huge gap: **there's no good way for agents to pay each other for services**. If an agent needs weather data, token prices, or premium analysis, it either has to be free or use clunky traditional payment systems.

So I built **AgentPayKit** – an SDK that lets any developer monetize any API endpoint with sub-cent stablecoin payments on Layer 2s.

**How it works:**
1. Register your API endpoint: `agentpay register`
2. Set a price in USDC (e.g., $0.01 per call)
3. Agents pay and call your API in one line: `agentpay.payAndCall("weather-v1", {city: "NYC"}, {price: "0.01"})`

**What makes this interesting:**
- **Sub-cent payments**: $0.001-$0.01 per API call (impossible with traditional payments)
- **Smart wallet ready**: Auto-detects Account Abstraction wallets vs regular wallets
- **Multi-chain**: Works on Base, Arbitrum, Optimism (gas costs ~$0.01)
- **Framework integrations**: One-line wrappers for CrewAI, LangChain, FastAPI

**Real use cases I'm seeing:**
- Weather APIs charging $0.005 per call
- Token price feeds at $0.002 per query  
- Premium AI analysis at $0.05 per request
- Agent-to-agent payments (trading bots buying market data from data bots)

**Technical details:**
- Uses EIP-2612 permit() for gasless approvals
- Event-driven gateway that forwards paid requests
- 10% platform fee, 90% goes to API owner
- Open source (MIT license)

The agent economy is happening **right now** – I think we need payment infrastructure that's built for it. Curious what HN thinks!

**Links:**
- GitHub: https://github.com/agentpaykit/agentpaykit
- Demo: https://demo.agentpay.org
- Docs: https://docs.agentpay.org

**Try it:**
```bash
npm install @agentpay/sdk
# or
pip install agentpay
```

Would love feedback, especially from anyone building with AI agents or microservices!

### Engagement Strategy

**Timing:**
- Post Tuesday 10 AM PST (peak HN traffic)
- Monitor for first 2 hours actively
- Respond to every comment within 30 minutes

**Key Messages:**
1. **Problem is real**: Agent economy needs payment infrastructure
2. **Solution is simple**: One-line API monetization
3. **Timing is perfect**: Smart wallets + L2s make micro-payments viable
4. **Open source**: MIT license, community-driven

**Response Templates:**

*For technical questions:*
"Great question! The [specific feature] works by [explanation]. You can see the implementation in [GitHub link]. Happy to dive deeper!"

*For skepticism:*
"I totally get the skepticism – crypto payments have been clunky. But with Account Abstraction + L2s, it finally feels like web2 UX. Here's a 30-second demo: [link]"

*For competition questions:*
"You're right that [competitor] exists, but they focus on [difference]. AgentPayKit is specifically built for the agent economy with sub-cent payments and AI framework integrations."

## 🎯 ProductHunt Launch

### Tagline
"Stripe for AI agents – monetize APIs with crypto payments"

### Description
"AgentPayKit lets developers monetize any API endpoint with sub-cent stablecoin payments. Perfect for the agent economy where AI agents need to pay each other for services. One-line integration, smart wallet support, works on Layer 2s."

### Key Features
- ⚡ Sub-cent payments ($0.001-$0.01 per call)
- 🤖 AI framework integrations (CrewAI, LangChain)
- 🔗 Multi-chain support (Base, Arbitrum, Optimism)
- 🛡️ Smart wallet ready (Account Abstraction)
- 🔓 Open source (MIT license)

### Maker Comment
"Built this because I saw AI agents everywhere but no good way for them to pay each other. Traditional payments don't work for $0.01 API calls. With smart wallets + L2s, crypto micro-payments finally make sense. Would love feedback from the PH community!"

## 📱 Social Media Strategy

### Twitter Thread
```
🧵 1/8 Just launched AgentPayKit – Stripe for AI agents! 

Finally, a way for agents to pay each other for services with sub-cent stablecoin payments.

📖 Docs: [link]

#AI #crypto #agents #web3
```

```
2/8 The problem: AI agents are everywhere, but there's no good way for them to pay each other.

Need weather data? Token prices? Premium analysis? 

It's either free (unsustainable) or traditional payments (too expensive for micro-transactions).
```

```
3/8 AgentPayKit solves this with:

⚡ Sub-cent payments ($0.001-$0.01 per call)
🤖 One-line integration 
🔗 Multi-chain (Base, Arbitrum, Optimism)
🛡️ Smart wallet support
🔓 Open source (MIT)

Perfect for the agent economy! 🚀
```

```
4/8 How it works:

1️⃣ Register your API: `agentpay register`
2️⃣ Set price in USDC (e.g., $0.01)
3️⃣ Agents pay & call: `agentpay.payAndCall("weather-v1", data, {price: "0.01"})`

That's it! You're now earning from your API. 💰
```

```
5/8 Real examples I'm seeing:

🌤️ Weather APIs: $0.005/call
📈 Token prices: $0.002/query  
🧠 AI analysis: $0.05/request
🤖 Agent-to-agent: Trading bots buying data from other bots

The agent economy is happening NOW.
```

```
6/8 Technical highlights:

• EIP-2612 permit() for gasless approvals
• Auto-detects smart wallets vs EOAs
• Event-driven gateway architecture
• 90% revenue to API owner, 10% platform fee
• Gas costs ~$0.01 on L2s

Built for 2025's crypto UX! ✨
```

```
7/8 Framework integrations:

🐍 Python: CrewAI, LangChain tools
⚡ FastAPI: @paywall decorator
🟦 TypeScript: One-line SDK
🔧 CLI: Easy registration

Making it dead simple for developers to monetize APIs.
```

```
8/8 This is just the beginning!

The agent economy needs payment infrastructure. AgentPayKit is open source and ready for the community to build on.

Try it: npm install @agentpay/sdk

What would you build with pay-per-call APIs? 🤔
