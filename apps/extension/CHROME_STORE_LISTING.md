# x402Pay - Instant Micropayments for the Web

Pay pennies for premium content, API calls, and digital services without subscriptions or accounts. x402Pay is the first browser wallet for the x402 payment protocol.

## What is x402Pay?

x402Pay enables instant micropayments for paywalled content using USDC stablecoins on the Base blockchain. No signups, no monthly subscriptions—just pay-per-use for what you actually consume.

### Key Features

✓ **No Subscriptions** - Only pay for what you use, starting at $0.01
✓ **$3 Free Credits** - Try the system risk-free with starter credits
✓ **USDC Payments** - Stablecoin payments on Base blockchain (low fees)

✓ **Receipt History** - Track all payments with full transaction records

## How It Works

1. **Browse the web normally** - Visit any site with premium content
2. **See a payment prompt** - When you hit a paywall, x402Pay shows the price
